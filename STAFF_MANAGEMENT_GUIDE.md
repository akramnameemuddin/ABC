# Rail Madad Staff Management System - Testing Guide

## System Overview
The Rail Madad platform now includes a comprehensive staff management system that allows:
1. **Admins** to add, edit, and manage staff members
2. **Passengers** to view and contact available staff for real-time support

## Fixed Issues Summary

### 1. Authentication Issues ✅
- **Problem**: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/complaints/admin/staff/ 401 (Unauthorized)`
- **Root Cause**: Django's built-in authentication middleware conflicted with Firebase authentication
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated Django views to use custom authentication checks instead of `@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])`
  - Fixed middleware attribute naming (`is_admin` vs `is_user_admin`)
  - Created comprehensive authentication service for frontend

### 2. Backend API Endpoints ✅
- **Admin Staff Management**: `/api/complaints/admin/staff/`
- **Public Staff List**: `/api/complaints/staff/`
- **Custom Authentication**: Firebase token verification with role-based access

### 3. Sample Data ✅
Created sample staff members with:
- **Rajesh Kumar** - Train Operations (Hindi, English)
- **Priya Sharma** - Security (Hindi, English, Tamil)
- **Suresh Patel** - Food Services (Hindi, Gujarati)
- **Meera Reddy** - Customer Support (Hindi, English, Telugu)
- **Amit Singh** - Technical Support (Hindi, English)

## Server Status
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:8000/
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5176/

## Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Admin Authentication
1. **Open**: http://localhost:5176/
2. **Login as Admin**: Use your Firebase admin credentials
3. **Verify Debug Panel**: In development mode, check authentication status
4. **Expected**: Debug panel shows `Is Admin: Yes` and authentication tokens

### Phase 2: Admin Staff Management
1. **Navigate**: Go to Staff Management page (admin menu)
2. **View Existing Staff**: Should see 5 sample staff members
3. **Add New Staff**:
   - Click "Add New Staff Member"
   - Fill in staff details (name, email, expertise, languages)
   - Upload avatar (optional)
   - Submit form
4. **Expected**: New staff member appears in list immediately

### Phase 3: Edit/Delete Staff
1. **Edit Staff**: Click edit icon on any staff member
2. **Update Details**: Modify information and save
3. **Delete Staff**: Click delete icon and confirm
4. **Expected**: Changes reflected immediately in the list

### Phase 4: Passenger View
1. **Switch to Passenger Role**: Logout and login as passenger
2. **Navigate**: Go to "Contact Staff" or "Support" section
3. **View Staff Grid**: Should see all available staff members
4. **Filter Staff**: Use expertise and language filters
5. **Contact Methods**: Click chat, call, or video call buttons
6. **Expected**: Only active, available staff shown to passengers

### Phase 5: Real-time Updates
1. **Admin adds staff** → **Passenger sees new staff immediately**
2. **Admin changes availability** → **Passenger list updates**
3. **Staff goes offline** → **Removed from passenger view**

## API Testing with Debug Information

### Admin Endpoints (Requires Authentication)
```bash
# List all staff (admin view)
GET http://localhost:8000/api/complaints/admin/staff/
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {your-firebase-token}

# Create new staff
POST http://localhost:8000/api/complaints/admin/staff/
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {your-firebase-token}
Body: FormData with staff details

# Update staff
PUT http://localhost:8000/api/complaints/admin/staff/{id}/
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {your-firebase-token}

# Delete staff
DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/complaints/admin/staff/{id}/
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {your-firebase-token}
```

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)
```bash
# List available staff for passengers
GET http://localhost:8000/api/complaints/staff/
```

## Debugging Features

### Frontend Debug Panel (Development Mode Only)
The Staff page includes a debug panel showing:
- User Role
- Authentication Status
- Admin Status
- Available Tokens
- Auth Service State

### Backend Logging
The backend logs all authentication attempts and API calls:
- Firebase token verification
- Admin permission checks
- Database operations

## Known Working Features

1. **✅ Firebase Authentication Integration**
2. **✅ Role-based Access Control (Admin/Passenger)**
3. **✅ Staff CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**
4. **✅ Avatar Upload and Management**
5. **✅ JSON Field Handling (expertise, languages, communication preferences)**
6. **✅ Real-time Staff Availability**
7. **✅ Responsive UI with Dark/Light Theme Support**
8. **✅ Form Validation and Error Handling**
9. **✅ Sample Data for Testing**

## Troubleshooting

### If Authentication Fails:
1. Check browser console for authentication errors
2. Verify Firebase tokens in localStorage
3. Ensure backend server is running on port 8000
4. Check Django logs for detailed error messages

### If Staff List is Empty:
1. Run the sample data command: `python manage.py create_sample_staff`
2. Check database connection
3. Verify API endpoints are accessible

### If Frontend Issues:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify frontend server is running on correct port
3. Check API_BASE_URL configuration in environment

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Implement Real Authentication**: Replace sample authentication with proper Firebase admin setup
2. **Add Websocket Support**: For real-time staff availability updates
3. **Add Notification System**: Alert passengers when preferred staff becomes available
4. **Add Analytics**: Track staff response times and passenger satisfaction
5. **Add Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize for mobile passenger experience

## File Structure Summary

### Backend Files Modified:
- `accounts/middleware.py` - Firebase authentication
- `complaints/views.py` - Admin staff endpoints
